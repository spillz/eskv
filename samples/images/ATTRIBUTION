English: View of the International Space Station from the departing Space Shuttle on mission STS-110.
The International Space Station (ISS), newly equipped with the 27,000 pound S0 (S-zero) truss, 
was photographed with a digital still camera by one of the astronauts on board the Space Shuttle 
Atlantis. Seen just above center frame, S0 is the first segment of a truss structure which will 
ultimately expand the station to the length of a football field. Atlantis pulled away from the 
complex at 1:31 p.m. (CDT) as the two spacecraft flew some 247 statute miles above Earth. 
After more than a week of joint operations between the shuttle and station crews, astronaut 
Stephen N. Frick, pilot, backed Atlantis away to a distance of about 400 feet in front of the 
station, where he began a 1 1/4 lap flyaround of the ISS.
