# ESKV

ESKV is a JavaScript widget library for the browser inspired by Kivy. 
It is built on EcmaScript 6 and the Html5 Canvas. Like Kivy, ESKV lets you rapidly 
build apps with rich user experiences that consolidate mouse and touch friendly 
controls into one simple interface and runs on the web.
