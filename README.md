# ESKV

ESKV is a JavaScript widget library for the browser inspired by Kivy. 
It is built on EcmaScript 6 and the Html5 Canvas. Like Kivy, ESKV lets you rapidly 
build apps with rich user experiences that consolidate mouse and touch friendly 
controls into one simple interface and, unlike Kivy, run directly in the browser on 
most modern devices.

Try samples on my [GitHub pages](https://spillz.github.io/eskv).

To test the samples locally

```
git clone https://github.com/spillz/eskv
cd eskv
python3 -m http.server
```

Open 0.0.0.0:8000/index.html in your browser of choice. If you make changes to module code, 
you may need to clear the browser's cache to see the updates.
